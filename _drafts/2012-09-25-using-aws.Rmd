Stuff needed to get a RStudio AMI going on Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

### Install dependencies for RCurl 
Learned from [here](http://www.omegahat.org/RCurl/FAQ.html) that once inside the Linux box on the AWS instance, run `sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev`. 

### Install dependencies for XML
Learned from [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7765429/unable-to-install-r-package-in-ubuntu-11-04), that once inside the Linux box on the AWS instance, run `sudo apt-get update` then `sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev`. 

### These will allow to do `library(RCurl)` and `library(XML)`, both important for making web calls.
