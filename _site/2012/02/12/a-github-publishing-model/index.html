<h1>Will a GitHub publishing model work?</h1>
	<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Publishing and publishers are stagnant, and have not innovated much in a long time, save a few such as <a href="http://www.plos.org/publications/journals/">Public Library of Science or PLoS</a>.</p>

<p>Beyond PLoS, some experiments in publishing are taking place, including:
* <a href="http://annotum.org/">Annotum</a>: an "open-source, open-process, open-access scholarly authoring and publishing platform based on WordPress"
* <a href="http://scholasticahq.com/">Scholastica</a>: a peer-review, manuscript handling web-based platform.
* <a href="http://www.peerageofscience.org/">Peerage of Science</a>: a web service for "automatically controlled, standardized, rigorous, fully anonymous scientific peer review"
* <a href="http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/">GigaScience</a>: online open-access open-data journal, with big-data studies, links standard manuscript publication with database for associated data, data anlaysis tools, and cloud-computing resources.</p>

<p>All these publishing innovations are great.  But, I think we need more, as do others.  A few weeks ago, a number of us discussed on Twitter the possibility of a publishing model based on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.  (Marcio von Muhlen had a blog post in April last year titled <a href="http://marciovm.com/i-want-a-github-of-science/index.html">"We need a GithHub of science"</a> - which I should point out here as it is relavant.)</p>

<h1>The proposal</h1>

<p>What would a GitHub hosted journal look like?  I think there are three technological/software components (not counting human components of reviewers editors, etc.):
1. Web platform/database for hosting manuscripts in various stages from just submitted to revisions to published.<br/>
2. Review system, including database of reviewers, the reviews themselves, etc.
3. A frontend to present the papers/etc, submit manuscripts, and CSS to make it all look pretty.</p>

<p>In my opinion, GitHub can play a major role in numbers (1) and (3).  In (1), the git based versioning of code could also be used to submit and handle papers.  In addition, wrt (3), <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is a way to present content in a static web page from one of the branches of your GitHub repository.  See <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/sites">here</a> for a growing list of websites hosted on GitHub pages.  Presenting published and early view papers, etc. doesn't need to have some insane website, so this could be a cheap way to do it. And you can use a custom domain name for the journal, e.g., go from myjournal.github.com to myjournal.com.</p>

<p>As for (2), the above-mentioned Scholastica or Peerage of Science could be an option for handling peer reviews.</p>

<h1>Disadvantages and advantages</h1>

<h2>The disadvantages</h2>

<p>So a GitHub hosted journal has obivous drawbacks...
* Technical knowhow: Some scientists may not know how to use git, and if papers have to be submitted in Latex, then you will eliminate many potential authors possibly.
* There aren't rich web markup tools.
* Others?</p>

<h2>The advantages</h2>

<p>...and advantages
* Completely open: A GitHub journal would be completely open, so that the public/scientists could see everything that was going on in the journal, including all the manuscript revisions, and reviews if they were done on GitHub, or at least mirrored to GitHub.
* API: GitHub has a built in API, so we don't have to build one ourselves.
* Versioning: manuscripts would include automatic versioning, including tracking down to the periods that were changed between versions
* Metrics: GitHub has built in metrics on "watchers", "followers", and for clones and forks, among other things. In addition, we could pull altmetrics data from the <a href="http://totalimpact.org/">TotalImpact</a> API, and present those data associated with papers on the rendered website for the journal. Of course, anyone could hit the TotalImpact, or GitHub APIs themselves for these metrics too.
* Pull requests: maybe pull requests could be used to submit papers.</p>

<p>The question is do these advantages outweigh the potential drawbacks.  I don't know the answer to this question, but I think this conversation is worth having.</p>

<h1>What would the structure look like on GitHub?</h1>

<p>Maybe like this:</p>

<h1>What do you think?</h1>

<p>What do you think?  Does this journal idea sound feasible? Should we just start a journal hosted on GitHub and see what happens?</p>
