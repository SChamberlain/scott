Education
---------

* 2012 Ph.D Dept. of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, Rice University
* 2009 M.A. Dept. of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, Rice University
* 2003 B.S. Biological Sciences, California State University

Programming
------------

* R: I have developed R software for 7 years, for research projects, and as packages (see them [on GitHub](https://github.com/sckott)). I co-founded a developer collective to make R software tools for scientists called rOpenSci ([http://ropensci.org/](http://ropensci.org/)). 
* Python: I have programmed in Python for about a year now, and am relatively comfortable throughtout the language, having used it for a variety of simulations. 
* Ruby: I have picked up Ruby in the last year as well, and am getting more comfortable (e.g. a) I have deployed [an app to Heroku](http://rodash.herokuapp.com/roapi) to monitor the many web APIs that we at rOpenSci consume, and b) I wrote a tiny gem to get Bibtex style references by inputting a DOI [here](https://github.com/sckott/doiref)).
* HTML/CSS: I use HTML often for my own website and blog, and occasionally customize CSS. 
* Databases: I am familiar with and use many databases, including SQL (MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (CouchDB).

Publications
-------

I have 16 peer-reviewed publications, some in top journals in my field, including the top journal in my field, Ecology Letters. 

Projects
-------

I co-founded a developer collective to make R packages to facilitate use of open source journals and data sets. [Website](http://ropensci.org/); [Code](https://github.com/ropensci). We recieved a ~$160,000 grant in June 2012 for one year, and are likely to get more funding in the next round.
