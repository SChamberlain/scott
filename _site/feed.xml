				<title>Notes on doing in-person science interviews</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;From chat with Jai Ranganathan on doing in-person science interviews&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Choosing space
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;very quiet&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;air ventilation very loud - be cognisant of&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set up/use a media space, talk to conference folks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Microphones, two ways to go
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;setup that plugs in to the computer, a USB microphone, and record directly into &lt;a href=&quot;http://audacity.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;Audacity&lt;/a&gt;.
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;one mic $100 is a USB mic, and a plugin for another mic, brand: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Samson-Track-Microphone-Audio-Interface/dp/B0015MJE22&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Not plugged in: solid state microphone - thumb drive in the microphone, some have a 2 channel setup&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;loud computer, cold pack under computer to cool it down &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;audacity doesn’t save, only saves when you are done.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;microphone not connected to computer, then download to computer later.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Perfect way to do it is do analog to digital conversion outside computer then pass to computer
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;$1000 setup - 2 good condenser microphones that plug in to “Duet” hardware
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://new.apogeedigital.com/products/duet2.php&quot;&gt;Duet&lt;/a&gt; 
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;microphones for these are regular with like 1/4 jacks. &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anti-pop device: just screeen in front of microphone - look into, could build my own&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;He said max he could do is 4 in one day at a conference. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Podcasts vs. YouTube
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;podcasts are a niche group, but a fanatical group, so…&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;podcasts
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;need server space&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;should be relatively easy&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;http://transom.org/?s=microphones&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tips for voice
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;to interviewee before it starts: “relax”&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;have an arc of the conversation beforehand, then go over with them, and see if they are okay with it&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;book to read
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Sound-Reporting-Guide-Journalism-Production/dp/0226431789&quot;&gt;NPR guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;keep your voice level, talk slowly very important - 2/3 normal rate.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;get admin access to Journal of Ecology website somehow…?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Digital lysenkoism - an apt analogy for academic publishing?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Here, I argue that Cory Doctorow’s analogy of publishers insistence on DRM as digitial lysenkoism, is an apt anology to describe many academic publishers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Cory Doctorow’s podcast &lt;a href=&quot;http://craphound.com/&quot;&gt;Craphound&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://craphound.com/?p=3890&quot;&gt;Cory read an essay&lt;/a&gt; he published in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/columns-and-blogs/cory-doctorow/article/50413-with-a-little-help-digital-lysenkoism.html&quot;&gt;Publisher’s Weekly&lt;/a&gt; titled “Digital Lysenkoism”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this essay, Cory suggests that publishers inistence on DRM (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRM&quot;&gt;digital rights management&lt;/a&gt;) is like digital lysenkoism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is lysenkoism? It is basically descendant from Lamarckism, which is a discredited theory that an organism can pass on characteristics acquired during its lifetime to its offspring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this applies to academic publishers, in the following context: Academic publishers, (e.g., Elsevier) have been peddling a very old publishing model for a long time. Academic publishers surely created value when reprinting scientific articles was extremely expensive.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the present, publishing costs are falling, while publisher profits are rising. Publishers are trying to tack on this (comments sections that no one uses) and that (paywalls, charging $30 per paper), like DRM for book publishers, in attempt to survive and make more profits. Instead, they need to evolve, or be pushed out of the way in a struggle for existence against newcomers such as PLoS and PENSOFT. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Abstract for ESAA 2012 meeting</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I admit that this abstract was written very hastily, but how much better can you do so far ahead of when the actual thing will happen anyhow.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;title-effects-of-agriculture-on-evolution-of-native-species&quot;&gt;Title: Effects of agriculture on evolution of native species&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;backgroundquestionmethods&quot;&gt;Background/Question/Methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anthropogenic disturbances, such as urbanization, fragmentation, and introduction of invasive species, can homogenize biotic communities by reducing the variation in species composition across locations. For example, global agricultural intensification has ¬increased pesticide use has and led to increased similarities in both bee and hemipteran communities relative to non-agricultural areas. Agriculture has the potential to significantly impact diversity of natural communities. Proximity to agriculture may lead to altered evolutionary trajectories for native species via altered natural selection. No studies have experimentally examined the possible evolutionary consequences of landscape-level homogenization of biotic interactions. We explored how proximity of wild plants (Helianthus annuus texanus) to crops (crop sunflowers: Helianthus annuus) altered their mutualist and antagonist interaction partners, and subsequent altered natural selection on traits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;resultsconclusions&quot;&gt;Results/Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By experimentally manipulating the proximity of a native sunflower species to crop sunflowers, we found that mutualist pollinators largely increased in abundance on wild sunflowers near sunflower crops, while antagonists decreased abundance on wild sunflowers near sunflower crops.  In turn, natural selection on floral traits was altered across the landscape due to changes in abundance and community structure of mutualists and antagonists. Crops altered natural selection on floral traits of native sunflowers, and reduced spatial variation in selection near relative to far from crops. Furthermore, all floral traits have nonzero heritabilities, suggesting that altered natural selection will have evolutionary consequences for this species.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Remember to ressurect paper on EFN scaling with plant size</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I have been wanting to write a paper on the the topic of whether mutualistic rewards scale with oranism size, as a way to control the costs of investment in attracting mutualistic partners. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My questions so far are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do quantity and/or quality of mutualistic rewards scale (correlate) with plant size?	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prediction: Not sure exactly what null hypothesis should be, other than a null slope of zero. Benefits of producing rewards may saturate at large plant size, thus causing the reward-size relationship to saturate. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does the relationship between rewards and plant size vary among species? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prediction: Species more closely related should display similar reward-size relationships. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be very little literature out there on this topic.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a cartoon that I made back in 2008 (!) - not sure it makes sense, but…here it is anyway. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Will a GitHub publishing model work?</title>
				<description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publishing and publishers are stagnant, and have not innovated much in a long time, save a few such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.plos.org/publications/journals/&quot;&gt;Public Library of Science or PLoS&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond PLoS, some experiments in publishing are taking place, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://annotum.org/&quot;&gt;Annotum&lt;/a&gt;: an “open-source, open-process, open-access scholarly authoring and publishing platform based on WordPress”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scholasticahq.com/&quot;&gt;Scholastica&lt;/a&gt;: a peer-review, manuscript handling web-based platform. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peerageofscience.org/&quot;&gt;Peerage of Science&lt;/a&gt;: a web service for “automatically controlled, standardized, rigorous, fully anonymous scientific peer review”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/&quot;&gt;GigaScience&lt;/a&gt;: online open-access open-data journal, with big-data studies, links standard manuscript publication with database for associated data, data anlaysis tools, and cloud-computing resources. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these publishing innovations are great.  But, I think we need more, as do others.  A few weeks ago, a number of us discussed on Twitter the possibility of a publishing model based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.  (Marcio von Muhlen had a blog post in April last year titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://marciovm.com/i-want-a-github-of-science/index.html&quot;&gt;“We need a GithHub of science”&lt;/a&gt; - which I should point out here as it is relavant.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-proposal&quot;&gt;The proposal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would a GitHub hosted journal look like?  I think there are three technological/software components (not counting human components of reviewers editors, etc.):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Web platform/database for hosting manuscripts in various stages from just submitted to revisions to published.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Review system, including database of reviewers, the reviews themselves, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A frontend to present the papers/etc, submit manuscripts, and CSS to make it all look pretty. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, GitHub can play a major role in numbers (1) and (3).  In (1), the git based versioning of code could also be used to submit and handle papers.  In addition, wrt (3), &lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; is a way to present content in a static web page from one of the branches of your GitHub repository.  See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/sites&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a growing list of websites hosted on GitHub pages.  Presenting published and early view papers, etc. doesn’t need to have some insane website, so this could be a cheap way to do it. And you can use a custom domain name for the journal, e.g., go from myjournal.github.com to myjournal.com.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for (2), the above-mentioned Scholastica or Peerage of Science could be an option for handling peer reviews.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;disadvantages-and-advantages&quot;&gt;Disadvantages and advantages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-disadvantages&quot;&gt;The disadvantages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a GitHub hosted journal has obivous drawbacks…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical knowhow: Some scientists may not know how to use git, and if papers have to be submitted in Latex, then you will eliminate many potential authors possibly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There aren’t rich web markup tools. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Others?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-advantages&quot;&gt;The advantages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…and advantages&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Completely open: A GitHub journal would be completely open, so that the public/scientists could see everything that was going on in the journal, including all the manuscript revisions, and reviews if they were done on GitHub, or at least mirrored to GitHub. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;API: GitHub has a built in API, so we don’t have to build one ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Versioning: manuscripts would include automatic versioning, including tracking down to the periods that were changed between versions&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Metrics: GitHub has built in metrics on “watchers”, “followers”, and for clones and forks, among other things. In addition, we could pull altmetrics data from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://totalimpact.org/&quot;&gt;TotalImpact&lt;/a&gt; API, and present those data associated with papers on the rendered website for the journal. Of course, anyone could hit the TotalImpact, or GitHub APIs themselves for these metrics too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pull requests: maybe pull requests could be used to submit papers.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is do these advantages outweigh the potential drawbacks.  I don’t know the answer to this question, but I think this conversation is worth having. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-would-the-structure-look-like-on-github&quot;&gt;What would the structure look like on GitHub?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/embed?id=1J7DSxk0H90NVcRvPhug4UYcH_pCngMWO7-aIeqAxIeA&amp;amp;start=false&amp;amp;loop=false&amp;amp;delayms=3000&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;389&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-you-think&quot;&gt;What do you think?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think?  Does this journal idea sound feasible? Should we just start a journal hosted on GitHub and see what happens?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Tuesday Jan 10, 2012 Notes</title>
				<description>&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recology blog: 
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;add Pascal as an author&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;add rOpenSci image button with link to About sidebar&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fix category links!!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Videos for Journal of Ecology blog: need to figure out why guest voice is super quiet. Perhaps something wrong with the .mov file extension when importing to YouTube. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Edit &lt;code&gt;loghistplot&lt;/code&gt; function &lt;a href=&quot;http://schamberlain.github.com/2012/01/logistic-regression-barplot-fig/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to include more options
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;allow users to manipulate colors&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;include points along with histogram&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;more?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

				<title>Self publishing</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;What if scientists just published their papers after peer review on their own websites?  Authors (&lt;a href=&quot;http://craphound.com/?p=3672&quot;&gt;Cory Doctorow&lt;/a&gt;), musicians (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/wilco-to-self-release-the-whole-love-in-september-20110629&quot;&gt;Wilco&lt;/a&gt;), and comedians (&lt;a href=&quot;https://buy.louisck.net/&quot;&gt;Louis C.K.&lt;/a&gt;) are starting to do this in small numbers, and having some sucess.  They don’t need peer review, but perhaps a site could be started where authors could solicit reviewers.  Self publishing would allow scientists to make everything free - papers, data, figures - everything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps what we need is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; for science publishing.  It would be all open access, would provide version control so that papers could be continually updated, and you can drill down into the data directly from figures.  And of course, the code could all be hosted at this site.  &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Should the old thesis model die?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;So, the traditional Ph.D. thesis model involves 3 to 5 chapters on one topic &amp;#8211; an in-depth investigation of one question, or a series of tightly related questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, collaborative work across labs, political borders, and conceptual borders, is increasingly occurring, either due to decreasing funding or other reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet we hang on to the traditional thesis model concentrating on one single question, with all the chapters related.  Why can&amp;#8217;t a thesis mirror what is likely to happen post thesis work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, my thesis involves three different projects (two projects with one paper each, and one project with two papers), and are only united in the sense that they investigate species interactions  - albeit across ecology and evolution.  Beyond my actual thesis chapters, I have been involved in a number of collaborative projects, some leading to papers, some not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sort of model of a thesis I think matches more closely what one is likely to due in a research job &amp;#8211; that is, work on a various different projects, with various collaborators, on sometimes unrelated questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder how common this sort of thesis model is, one with more collaborative work and more distantly related questions than the traditional model?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
