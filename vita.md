Education
---------
* 2012 Ph.D Dept. of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, Rice University
* 2009 M.A. Dept. of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, Rice University
* 2003 B.S. Biological Sciences, California State University

Programming
------------
* R >> I have developed R software for 8 years, for research projects, and as packages (see them [on GitHub](https://github.com/sckott)). I co-founded a developer collective to make R software tools for scientists called rOpenSci ([http://ropensci.org/](http://ropensci.org/)).
* Python >> I have programmed in Python for 2 years, and am relatively comfortable throughtout the language, having used it for a variety of simulations.
* Ruby >> I have picked up Ruby in the last year as well, and am getting more comfortable (e.g. a) I have deployed [an app to Heroku](http://rodash.herokuapp.com/roapi) to monitor the many web APIs that we at rOpenSci consume, and b) I wrote a tiny gem to get Bibtex style references by inputting a DOI [here](https://github.com/sckott/doiref)).
* HTML/CSS >> I use HTML often for my own website and blog, and occasionally customize CSS.
* Databases >> I am familiar with and use many databases, including SQL (MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (CouchDB). I am also  familiar with Elasticsearch and Solr, and have created R clients for both of them.

Work Experience
------------
* 2011-pres rOpenSci: co-founded developer collective to make R (#rstats) packages to facilitate use of open source journals and data sets. [Website](http://ropensci.org/); [Code](https://github.com/ropensci).  rOpenSci is now housed within UC Berkeley.
