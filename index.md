### I co-founded a developer collective called <a href="http://ropensci.org/">rOpenSci</a> to help connect open source data into the R environment. I'm currently working full time on rOpenSci at UC Berkeley.

### Software

* R >> [taxize][taxize] - [rgbif][rgbif] - [rplos][rplos] - [alm][alm] - [solr][solr]
* Python >> [pytaxize](https://github.com/sckott/pytaxize) - [pyalm](https://github.com/cameronneylon/pyalm)
* Ruby >> [cites](https://github.com/sckott/cites) - [alm](https://github.com/sckott/alm)
* [more software](/software)

<i class="fa fa-github"></i> See the rest <a href="https://github.com/sckott/" target="_blank">on Github</a>
