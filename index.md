### I co-founded a developer collective called <a href="http://ropensci.org/">rOpenSci</a> to help connect open source data into the R environment. I'm currently working full time on rOpenSci at UC Berkeley.

### Software

* R >> [taxize][taxize] - [rgbif][rgbif] - [rplos][rplos] - [alm][alm] - [solr][solr]
* Python >> [pytaxize](https://github.com/sckott/pytaxize) - [pyalm](https://github.com/articlemetrics/pyalm)
* Ruby >> [cites](https://github.com/sckott/cites) - [alm](https://github.com/articlemetrics/lagotto-rb)
* Web Services >> [fishbaseapi](https://github.com/ropensci/fishbaseapi), a Ruby Sinatra RESTful API - along w/ [Carl Boettiger][cboettig]
* [more software](/software)
