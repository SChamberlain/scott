Many R packages/tools have come out recently for doing ecology and evolution. All of the below were described in Methods in Ecology and Evolution, except for spider, which came out in [Molecular Ecology Resources](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1755-0998). Here are some highlights.

+ [mvabund][mvabund]
	+ Model-based analysis of multivariate abundance data. Visualising data, fitting predictive models, checking assumptions, hypothesis testing.
+ [popdemo][popdemo]
	+ Population demography using projection matrix analysis. 
+ [motmot][motmot] 
	+ Models of trait macroevolution on trees
+ [spider][spider] 
	+ Analysis of species identity and evolution, with particular reference to DNA barcoding
+ [BaSTA][BaSTA] 
	+ Bayesian estimation of age-specific survival from incomplete markâ€“recapture/recovery data with covariates
+ [abc][abc] 
	+ Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)
+ [RNetLogo][RNetLogo]
	+ Running and exploring individual-based models implemented in NetLogo
+ [phytools][phytools]
	+ Tools for phylogenetic comparative biology
+ [smatr3][smatr3]
	+ Estimation and inference about allometric lines
+ [RBrownie][brown]
	+ Testing hypotheses about rates of evolutionary change
+ [polytomy resolver][poly] 
	+ Resolve polytomies on dated phylogenies with their R scripts [here][].

And a cool tool came out for the Python programming language. 

+ [NichePy][NichePy]
	+ Modular tools for estimating the similarity of ecological niche and species distribution models
