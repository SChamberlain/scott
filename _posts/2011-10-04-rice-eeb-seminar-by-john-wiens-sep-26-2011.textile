<ul>
	<li>Weins suggests that species interactions are important for evolution of climatic tolerances (i.e., climatic niche conservatism)</li>
	<li>pseudo-quote from Weins: "species interactions are important in constraining evolutionary change, not just driving evolutionary change"</li>
	<li>climatic niche conservatism is one way that links species interaction outcomes and species richness....</li>
	<li>note to self, while talk was going: although more species richness in tropics in general, it may be that more functional diversity is found in temperate areas, BECAUSE Weins shows that in many clades there is more diversity of deep nodes in temperate areas than in tropical areas (few clades are found in tropical areas in his data, but those that are have a lot of species).</li>
