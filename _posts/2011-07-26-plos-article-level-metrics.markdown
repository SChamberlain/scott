PLoS just announced their article level metrics API: http://api.plos.org/alm/faq/. This is very exciting, and I need to include these new data sources our <a href="https://github.com/SChamberlain/rplos" target="_blank">rplos package for R</a>. Examples of use of this API here: http://api.plos.org/alm/examples/.
