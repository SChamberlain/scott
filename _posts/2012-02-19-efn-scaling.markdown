I have been wanting to write a paper on the the topic of whether mutualistic rewards scale with oranism size, as a way to control the costs of investment in attracting mutualistic partners. 

My questions so far are:

1. Do quantity and/or quality of mutualistic rewards scale (correlate) with plant size?	

* Prediction: Not sure exactly what null hypothesis should be, other than a null slope of zero. Benefits of producing rewards may saturate at large plant size, thus causing the reward-size relationship to saturate. 


2. Does the relationship between rewards and plant size vary among species? 

* Prediction: Species more closely related should display similar reward-size relationships. 

There seems to be very little literature out there on this topic.   

Below is a cartoon that I made back in 2008 (!) - not sure it makes sense, but...here it is anyway.
