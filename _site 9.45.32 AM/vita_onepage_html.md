<!-- Education
---------

* 2012 Ph.D Dept. of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, Rice University
* 2009 M.A. Dept. of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, Rice University
* 2003 B.S. Biological Sciences, California State University

Work Experience
------------

* __PostDoctoral Researcher__ 2012-present. Simon Fraser University, British Columbia, Canada. I synthesize data from a research network across Canada to ask questions about pollinator communities. I have written four papers during this postdoc, and have built and maintain a SQL database containing database from the research network. 
* __rOpenSci__ 2011-present. I co-founded a developer collective to make R packages to facilitate use of open source journals and data sets. [Website](http://ropensci.org/); [Code](https://github.com/ropensci). We recieved a ~$160,000 grant in June 2012 for one year, and are likely to get more funding in the next round. In developing software I use R, which I have used for 8 years. In addition, I help maintain a website and make web tutorials with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Programming
------------

* __R__ I have developed R software for 8 years, for research projects, and as packages (see them [on GitHub](https://github.com/sckott)). 
* __Python__ I have programmed in Python for about a year now, having used it for a variety of simulations. In addition, I am writing a Python package for getting taxonomy data from the web.
* __Ruby__ I have programmed in Ruby for about a year now. I have deployed [an app to Heroku](http://rodash.herokuapp.com/roapi) to monitor the many web APIs that we at rOpenSci consume, and b) I wrote a Ruby package [doiref](https://github.com/sckott/doiref) to search for articles, and get Bibtex style references by inputting a DOI.
* __HTML/CSS__ I use HTML often for my own website and blog, and occasionally customize CSS. 
* __Databases__ I am familiar with and use many databases, including SQL (MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (CouchDB).
* __Scala/Clojure__ I have played around a bit with these, but have not used them extensively.

Publications
-------

I have 16 peer-reviewed publications, some in top journals in my field, including the top journal in my field, Ecology Letters, Ecology, and Oikos. I am first author in 10 of my 16 publications.
